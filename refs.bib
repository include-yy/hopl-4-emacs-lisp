  abstract =     {This paper introduces a new metaobject, the generalizer,
                  which complements the existing specializer metaobject.
                  With the help of examples, we show that this metaobject
                  allows for the efficient implementation of complex
                  non-class-based dispatch within the framework of existing
                  metaobject protocols.  We present our modifications to the
                  generic function invocation protocol from the Art of the
                  Metaobject Protocol; in combination with previous work,
                  this produces a fully-functional extension of the existing
                  mechanism for method selection and combination, including
                  support for method combination completely independent from
                  method selection.  We discuss our implementation, within
                  the SBCL implementation of Common Lisp, and in that
                  context compare the performance of the new protocol with
                  the standard one, demonstrating that the new protocol can
                  be tolerably efficient.}

                  Debugging with Psd is accomplished by instrumenting the

                  run, it presents the user with an interactive interface
                  that lets him or her examine and change values of
                  variables, set breakpoints, and single step evaluation.
                  Psd is designed to be run within GNU Emacs, which is used
                  for displaying the current source code position.}

                  our Standard ML compiler.  Debugging facilities are
                  provided by instrumenting the user's source code; this
                  approach, made feasible by ML's safety property, is
                  machine-independent and back-end independent.  Replay is
                  practical because ML is normally used functionally, and
                  our compiler uses continuation-passing style; thus most of
                  the program's state can be checkpointed quickly and
                  compactly using call-with-current-continuation.  Together,
                  instrumentation and replay support a simple and elegant
                  debugger featuring full variable display, polymorphic type
                  resolution, stack trace-back, breakpointing, and reverse
                  execution, even though our compiler is very highly
                  optimizing and has no run-time stack.}
