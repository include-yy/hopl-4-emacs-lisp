  While Emacs proponents largely agree that it is the world's greatest text
  editor, it is almost as much a Lisp machine disguised as an editor.
  Indeed, one of its chief appeals is that it is \emph{programmable} via its
  own programming language, \Elisp{} is a Lisp in the classic
  tradition.  In this article, we present the history of this language over
  its more than 30 years of evolution.  Its core has remained remarkably
  stable since its inception in 1985, in large part to preserve
  compatibility with the many third-party packages providing a multitude of
  extensions.  Still, \Elisp{} has evolved and continues to do so.

  Despite the fact that it is closely tied to a concrete editor,
  \Elisp{} has spawned multiple implementations---in Emacs itself but
  also in variants of Emacs, such as XEmacs, Edwin, and even the
  window manager Sawfish.  Through competing implementations as well
  as changes in maintainership, it has picked up outside influences
  over the years, most notably from Common Lisp.

  Important aspects of \Elisp{} have been shaped by
  concrete \emph{requirements} of the editor it supports, such as
  the \textit{buffer-local variables} that tie bindings to
  editing contexts, %FIXME: We used to say "buffers" but that's not defined!
  as well as implementation constraints.
  These requirements led to the choice of a Lisp dialect as Emacs's
  language in the first place, specifically its simplicity and dynamic nature:
  Loading additional Emacs packages or changing the ones in place
  occurs frequently, and having to restart the editor in order to
  re-compile or re-link the code would be unacceptable.  Fulfilling
  this requirement in a more static language would have been difficult
  at best.

  One of Lisp's chief characteristics is its malleability through its
  uniform syntax and the use of macros.  This has allowed the language to
  evolve much more rapidly and substantively than the evolution of its core
  would suggest, by letting Emacs packages provide new
  surface syntax.  In particular, \Elisp{} can be customized to look
  much like Common Lisp, and additional packages provide multiple-dispatch
  object systems, legible regular expressions, programmable pattern matching
  constructs, generalized variables, and more.
  Still, the core has also evolved, albeit slowly.  Most notably, it
  acquired support for lexical scoping.%%  through the involvement of
  %% programming-language researchers with Emacs maintainership.
  
  The timeline of \Elisp{}
  development is closely tied to the projects and people who have
  shaped it over the years: We document \Elisp{} history through its
  predecessors, Mocklisp and MacLisp, its early development up to the
  ``Emacs schism'' and the fork of Lucid Emacs, the development of
  XEmacs, and the subsequent rennaissance of Emacs development.
