We appreciate the many suggestions for improvement to the paper we
received from the reviewers: With the help of Brent Hailpern we have
tried to do them justice by making extensive revisions.

While we did make a todo list of all the individual suggestions to the
reviewers and ultimately (hopefully) ended up addressing the vast
majority of them, listing for each one what we did exactly would be
tedious and (we feel) pointless: The paper is overall quite different
from the original submission - in particular, it is significantly longer.

Here are some of the major improvements:

- We added a timeline of the Emacs evolution to the paper with
  references/links to the specific sections explaining the changes.

- We expanded the explanation of many Lisp constructs.

- We conducted a phone interview with Joseph Arceneaux (first
  maintainer of Emacs 19) about the Lucid Eamcs schism and reflected
  the results in the paper.

- Several people (notably Richard Stallman, Richard Gabriel, Richard
  Mlynarik and Jamie Zawinski) answered questions about specific
  aspects of the history and rationales by e-mail, whose answers are
  reflected in the paper.

- We tracked down many additional sources, and added the appropriate
  citations.

- We tracked down authorship for many aspects of Emacs Lisp that
  weren't part of the original submissions.

- We rewrote the conclusion to adequately summarize the trajectory the
  material takes now.

- In the end, we ended up not significantly restructuring the paper.
  The notable change we made was relegating the section on alternative
  implementations to the appendix.

We hope the revision meets your approval, and would be honored to be
included in HOPL IV.
